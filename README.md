# SPARTA_GLOBAL_JS_Intro

This is a YouTube page created through the use of HTML and CSS. This YouTube page focuses on the structure and layout of webpage rather than the functionality. It consists of placeholders like 1,2 etc to be in place of buttons that would be created through the use of JavaScript.  

The YouTube videos have been placed on the page through the use of iframe tag. It is an inline tag used to embed another document within the current HTML page, like a YouTube video. A media query has also been used to add a responsive feature to the page. The media query implemented on this webpage is used when the page becomes smaller. When a user minimises the screen the YouTube page created merges closer together and when it gets to 650px the position of the right side elements change position. The ad and more videos part of the page become relative to the position and move down. The two parts of the page are separated with div tags with the extra videos and ad are placed in a outer div tag and this is the tag that is manipulated with the media query.
